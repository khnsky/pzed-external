#### no original or good code lies beyond here
working functions for getting process addresses, handles and modules and ReadProcessMemeory / WriteProcessMemory wrappers and somewhat working auto bh (force jumps when in chat, buymenu and in console)

you'll need to get working offsets (you can do so using [hazedumper](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/cs-go-releases/169351-haze-dumper-json-config-based-offset-dumper-4.html) and put them in "offsets.h" or wherever.

a lot stolen from [SlimMem](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/c-and-c-/167302-slimmem-simple-memory-manipulation-class.html), some code _inspired_ form other places, some of my own.
